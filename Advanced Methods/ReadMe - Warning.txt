IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO THE ADVANCED METHOD THEN FOLLOW THIS VIDEO FROM ME TO
DISABLE WINDOWS UPDATES TO AVOID WINDOWS FROM BRICKING AFTER RUNNING AN
UPDATE AFTER DEBLOATING: https://youtu.be/lUoXSROpT4I

The only way you would be able to revert the advanced method is a restore point which is still not
guaranteed to work flawlessly so **DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!**

This debloating script removes ALL pre-installed programs that comes with Windows 10 including the Xbox Apps,
Office (PowerPoint, etc.), NVIDIA Control Panel For DCH DRIVERS, Microsoft Store & Much more leaving no bloatware.

Adamx Debloating Script v2 improves the following over v1:
1. You don't need to edit the batch files to your current user name anymore, The batch will now auto do it with no issues thanks to the %USERPROFILE% command.
2. Added more registry keys of bloatware to be removed in the "Remove Bloatware Registry Traces" batch.
3. Added the registry file to enable OLD windows GUI as replacement for task bar icons like Volume, Network, Battery (Laptops),
and also the basic windows photo viewer as a replacement for Photos app.

DISCLAIMER: If anything happens to your PC I am not held responsibility, You run tweaks and files at your own risk.
The batch file is tested heavily on multiple PCs, Mess Up = Wrong Steps.
